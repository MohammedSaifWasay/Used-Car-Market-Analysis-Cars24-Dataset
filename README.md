# 🚗 Used Car Market Analysis: Cars24 Dataset

This project presents a data-driven exploration of India’s used car market using a dataset from **Cars24**. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical modeling in **R**, this analysis uncovers insights into how features like fuel type, year, transmission, and price interact, with a goal to inform pricing strategies and buyer behavior patterns.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Cars24 (India)
- **Tool Used:** R (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Fuel type impact on pricing
  - Price depreciation by year
  - Comparison of manual vs. automatic transmission
  - Correlation of price with age and distance driven

## 🧱 Project Milestones

### 🚀 Milestone 1: Data Cleaning & Exploration
- Imported dataset and cleaned null/missing values.
- Renamed columns for clarity.
- Converted appropriate variables (e.g., Year, Fuel_Type) to factors.
- Removed outliers and filtered unrealistic data (e.g., cars older than 2000).

### 📊 Milestone 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Year-wise Price Trend:** Showed price depreciation over time.
- **Fuel Type vs Price:** Identified that Diesel cars tend to have higher resale value.
- **Transmission Analysis:** Compared Manual and Automatic cars across price and usage.
- **Distance vs Price:** Analyzed wear and tear impact on pricing.

### 🧠 Final Report Highlights
- **Insights:**
  - Newer vehicles (post-2015) retain value better.
  - Automatic transmission cars are generally priced higher.
  - Diesel vehicles are typically priced higher than Petrol or CNG.
  - Cars driven less than 50,000 km retain more value.
- **Visualization Techniques Used:**
  - Bar plots
  - Boxplots
  - Scatter plots with regression lines
  - Grouped histograms
